I'm Andy Li, a passionate Backend Software Developer based in Toronto, specializing in building robust applications for the logistics and e-commerce sectors. With extensive experience in both frontend and backend technologies, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and streamline operations. My journey in tech has equipped me with a versatile skill set, including proficiency in languages like Golang, Java, and TypeScript, as well as frameworks such as Nest.js and Spring Boot.

Collaboration is at the heart of my work ethic. I believe that the best solutions emerge from effective teamwork and open communication. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with diverse teams, where I’ve contributed to Agile development processes, conducted thorough code reviews, and engaged in continuous improvement initiatives. My goal is to align technical solutions with business objectives, ensuring that every project not only meets but exceeds expectations.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharing my insights through my blog. I also love to engage with the tech community, whether through GitHub contributions or participating in discussions on platforms like LinkedIn. My aim is to inspire others in their tech journeys while continuously learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.
