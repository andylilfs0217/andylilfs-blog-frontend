For someone who know me, you must know that I am a forgetful person. I always easily get distracted by other things. When I was working, I got distracted by making my lunch or watching YouTube. Or when I was working out, I got carried away by scrolling on social media. Therefore, you can probably guess that I forget important very often.

In the quest to combat my forgetfulness, I stumbled upon TickTick, a comprehensive to-do list app that has been a game changer for me. Not only does it allow me to jot down all my tasks, but it also sends me timely reminders so I don't miss out on anything important.

# Why TickTick?

I tried so many other different to-do managing apps, including Apple Reminders, Microsoft To-dos, Google Todo, and so much more. However, only TickTick covers most of my needs and helps me remember what matters the most.

# Basic functions - to-do list

TickTick's to-do list functionality is incredibly robust, allowing for a high level of customization and control. Its simple interface makes it easy to add tasks and subtasks, and you can even categorize tasks into different lists for better organization. This feature proves highly beneficial for managing tasks across various aspects of life, such as work, home, fitness, and personal goals.

Moreover, TickTick goes beyond the standard to-do list features by incorporating smart reminders. Not only can I set reminders based on time, but I can also set reminders based on your location. For instance, I can set a reminder to buy groceries when I am near my local supermarket. These features work together to ensure that I will never forget a task, regardless of how small or significant it may be.

# Porodomo timer

A simple to-do list cannot make TickTick stands out. Therefore, more features are integrated into the app and makes me feel more comfortable to use it.

One of the features I appreciate the most in TickTick is the Pomodoro timer. For those unfamiliar with the concept, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages people to work within the time they have, rather than struggling against it. You break your work into 25-minute intervals, each one followed by a short break. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros".

With the Pomodoro timer integrated directly into the TickTick app, I have found my productivity levels soaring. When I'm programming, for instance, I turn on the Pomodoro timer and it encourages me to fully concentrate on the task at hand for the set period of time. The ticking clock creates a sense of urgency, and knowing that a break is coming up keeps me motivated to stay focused.

This method not only helps me get more done, but also ensures I take regular breaks to rest and recharge. The Pomodoro timer in TickTick has truly revolutionized the way I approach my tasks, making me less prone to distraction and more efficient in juggling multiple responsibilities.

# Hobby tracking

Beyond the simple to-do list and Pomodoro timer, TickTick also offers a feature for habit tracking. This has been an incredibly useful tool for me as it helps in building and maintaining good habits. It's a separate section in the app where I can set specific habits that I want to develop and track my progress over time.

For instance, I have set habits for regular exercise and learning Japanese on the app. Every day, TickTick reminds me to dedicate some time to these activities. As I mark them as completed day by day, I can visualize my consistency and progress, which motivates me to keep going.

The habit tracker also has a flexible scheduling system that allows me to set habits for specific days of the week, making it adaptable to my changing schedule. It also sends me reminders for my habits, so I never forget to do them.

Moreover, I have added reading to my habit tracker. As a fan of books, I have always struggled to find the discipline to read consistently. With TickTick's habit tracker, I have been able to set aside specific times for reading and stick to them. It's been a game-changer for me as I have been able to read more books than ever before.

# See your progress

Maybe you would say, other apps can also do the same things as TickTick does. All TickTick did was only combining all functions into one app. You are actually right. However, gathering all functions into one creates another feature: you can visualize your achievements and goals.

On TickTick, you can see a complete overview of your tasks, habits, and progress all in one place. It's incredibly satisfying to see the tasks you've completed, the habits you've maintained, and the Pomodoros you've achieved. This overview provides a clear snapshot of your productivity, which can motivate you to keep improving.

In conclusion, TickTick has proven to be more than just a to-do list app for me. It's a comprehensive productivity tool that has helped me manage my tasks, focus my efforts, develop good habits, and track my progress. With its wide array of features and intuitive interface, TickTick has truly revolutionized the way I approach my day-to-day life. So, if you're in the market for a productivity app, I can't recommend TickTick highly enough. It's a game-changer.
