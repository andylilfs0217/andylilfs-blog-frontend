Recently, I took the AWS Cloud Practitioner Foundation Exam. I spent about one month studying for it. Here are some personal tips from my experience preparing for the exam.

# Courses

Most people start by purchasing courses from Udemy. Fortunately, I have a friend who had already bought a course from Udemy. Even though he couldn't share his account with me to allow me to watch the videos, he did share the PowerPoint that came with the course. That was the only learning material I used throughout my study journey.

# Practices

When studying for the exam, I think doing practice questions is very important, as it allows you to get used to the exam patterns. I did quite well by practicing past exam questions in my public exam. Therefore, I found numerous practice questions online and tried to answer them after studying. In my case, I practiced almost 975 questions (65*15) before I took the exam.

# Process

I took the exam on April 14th. On the morning of the exam day, I continued practicing the practice exam questions until 6 p.m. Originally, I had scheduled my exam for April 15th, but I grew weary of practicing all day long and was tired of worrying about the exam. So, I decided to reschedule the exam to 7 p.m. on the same day. I spent around 40 minutes completing the questions and eventually scored 84%, which was more than enough to pass the exam, as it requires a minimum of 70% to pass.
